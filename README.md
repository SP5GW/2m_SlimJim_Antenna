## 2 Meter Slim Jim Antenna Using 300 Ohm Twinlead
Project based on work of N4UJW and M0UKD and Antenna Design published in 
Polish Swiat Radio.

## Theor'y of operation
From [2]:
The Slim Jim, similar to the J-pole, is in fact a half wave end fed dipole, in the Slim Jim's 
case, an end fed folded dipole. As with all folded dipoles, the currents in each leg are in phase, 
but in the matching stub they in phase opposition, so little or no radiation occurs from the 
matching section (lambda/4 element). You may think how can you say this is a dipole, when its just one element? 
Well, contrary to popular belief, the dipole is so named because it has two electrical poles, 
not two physical poles.
Just like a magnet has two magnetic poles, a North and a South, we have two electrical poles, a Positive 
and a Negative. Being a half wave, there is always two opposite poles on the tips at each half cycle. 
Any half wave antenna is actually a dipole.

A dipole, is usually fed from the centre, where the impedance is about 70Ω. This provides a reasonable 
match to 50Ω coaxial cable, and is why the centre fed dipole is so widely used. A dipole can be fed 
anywhere along its radiator, for example, the windom is 'off centre' fed at the 200Ω point, and an end 
fed half wave will give a very high impedance of up to around 5000Ω.

So, we are feeding this half wave antenna from a high impedance point, which needs to be matched to 
50Ω coaxial cable, and is where the 'J Integrated Matching' (JIM) quarter wave matching section (λ/4) 
comes in. With the Slim Jim, you have the option to select the exact impedance you want, typically 50Ω. 
With the centre fed dipole, you have an impedance of around 70Ω.
